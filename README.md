Lower Back Pain
Low back pain is very normal now a days. Starting from old people to almost the IT people are suffering from back pain due to irregular sitting posture.
The lower back, which starts below the ribcage, is called the lumbar region.
It may be experienced as aching, burning, stabbing, sharp or dull, well-defined, or vague with intensity ranging from mild to severe.
The pain may begin suddenly or develop gradually. Non-specific low back pain is defined as low back pain not attributed to recognisable, known specific pathology.
